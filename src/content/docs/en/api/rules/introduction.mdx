Welcome to the Golf Rules API. This API provides programmatic access to the official golf rules as defined by the USGA, R&A and DGV. It allows developers to integrate golf rules into their applications, enabling features such as rule lookups, interpretations, and more.

## Key Features

- Limit the number of returned rules and paginate results using `limit` and `skip`.
- Group rules by categories using the `grouped` parameter (default: true).
- Retrieve a specific rule by its `id`.
- Full-text search in rule titles and texts with `search` (coming soon).
- Filter rules by category using `category` (e.g., "penalties").
- Sort results by fields like `ruleNumber`, `priority`, or `updatedAt` using `sortBy` and `sortOrder`.
- Support multiple languages via the `language` parameter.
- Query older rule versions with the `version` parameter.
- Include example texts with `includeExamples` (default: false).
- Include cross-references and links with `includeReferences` (default: false).

If you need any other features, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/realgolfgames/golfrules-api/issues). We are always looking to improve the API and add new features based on user feedback. You can also contribute to the project by submitting pull requests or suggesting improvements.

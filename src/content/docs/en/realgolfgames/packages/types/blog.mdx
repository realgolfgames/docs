The blog types provide developers with type safety when working with the blog endpoints in the RealGolf.Games project. This documentation will provide you with the information you need to get started with the blog types.

## Installation

To get started with the blog types, you will need to install the `@realgolfgames/types` package. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install @realgolfgames/types
# or
yarn add @realgolfgames/types
```

## How to use the types

Once you have installed the package, you can import the types into your project using the following code:

```typescript
import type {
  BlogTOC,
  Blog,
  ReturnedBlog,
  PostBlog,
  PatchBlog
} from '@realgolfgames/types';
```

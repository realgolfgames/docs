This is the RealGolf.Games Developer documentation. Here you will find everything you need to know to use the RealGolf.Games API, SDKs, and other tools to build your own golf-related applications.

## Getting Started

To get started you first need to create an account on the [RealGolf.Games website](https://realgolf.games).
Once you have an account, you can access the [Developer Portal](https://realgolf.games/developer) to manage your API keys, view your usage, and access other developer tools.

## API Documentation

The RealGolf.Games API documentation is available in the [API section](/developer/docs/en/api/introduction). Here you will find detailed information about the API endpoints, request and response formats, and examples of how to use the API.

## Types

The RealGolf.Games API uses TypeScript for its types. You can find the types in the [types section](/developer/docs/en/types/introduction). Here you will find detailed information about the types used in the API, including the properties and methods available for each type.

## SDKs

The RealGolf.Games SDKs are available in the [SDK section](/developer/docs/en/sdk/introduction). Here you will find detailed information about how to use the logging SDK to log events and errors in your applications. The SDK is only available for TypeScript and JavaScript applications, but you can use the API directly in any programming language that supports HTTP requests.

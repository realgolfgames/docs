The game types provide developers with type safety when working with the game endpoints in the RealGolf.Games project. This documentation will provide you with the information you need to get started with the game types.

## Installation

To get started with the game types, you will need to install the `@realgolfgames/types` package. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install @realgolfgames/types
# or
yarn add @realgolfgames/types
```

## How to use the types

Once you have installed the package, you can import the types into your project using the following code:

```typescript
import type {
  Game,
  Comment,
  Reply,
  Reaction
} from '@realgolfgames/types';
```

## Types

There are multiple types available for the game endpoints. Below is a list of the types available:

- `Game` - Represents a game.
- `Comment` - Represents a comment on a game.
- `Reply` - Represents a reply to a comment.

RealGolfGames provides developers with an npm package that contains all the types needed to work with the RealGolf.Games project. This documentation will provide you with the information you need to get started with the RealGolf.Games types.

## Getting started

Install the RealGolf.Games types package from npm using one of the following commands:

**NPM**:

```bash
npm install @realgolfgames/types
```

**Yarn**:

```bash
yarn add @realgolfgames/types
```

**PNPM**

```bash
pnpm add @realgolfgames/types
```

Once you have installed the package you can import the types into your project using the following code:

**Example for the Blogs Endpoint**:

```typescript
import type { ReturnedBlog } from '@realgolfgames/types';
```

And example code would look something like this:

```typescript
import type { ReturnedBlog, Blog } from '@realgolfgames/types';

const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.realgolf.games/v1/blogs?apiKey=your-api-key'
);

const data: ReturnedBlog[] = await response.json();

const { blogs }: Blog[] = data;
```

The above code will fetch the data from the `https://api.realgolf.games/v1/blogs` endpoint and destructur the data into the `blogs` variable.

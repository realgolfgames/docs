# RealGolf.Games Developer Docs

This repository contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for  
[realgolf.games/developer/docs](https://realgolf.games/developer/docs).

## Deployment

Every merge into the `main` branch triggers a redeploy of the RealGolf.Games frontend.  
Because of that, **all changes must go through a pull request and require review from an organization admin.**

## Allowed Contribution Types

We accept the following types of contributions:

- **Content edits:** typo fixes, better phrasing, updated or new explanations
- **Issues:** to report incorrect content, request improvements, or suggest new topics
- **Pull requests:** for changes to Markdown files, links, code examples, or structure
- **Translations:** if you're fluent in another language and want to help localize the docs
- **Code changes:** if the docs frontend needs UI fixes, build improvements, or CI/CD tweaks

We don’t accept feature requests for the main platform here — this repo is docs only.
